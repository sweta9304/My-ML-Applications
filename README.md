**Computer Hardware Performance:** This Dataset has info about hardware performance of various vendors and The goal of applying** linear regression** with these splits (80:20) and (90:10)  is to build a predictive model that can estimate hardware performance based on input features and then assess how well this model generalizes to new, unseen hardware configurations. The evaluation metrics used in both cases (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared) can help quantify the model's performance.
